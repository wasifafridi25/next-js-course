Next is better cause it makes react a lot more simpler like React makes JS simpler.
Better SEO than react
In React we have Client Side rendering. The browser starts off with an empty html file, which is the index.html 
file that just has the div. So, google bots can't read that and index it to rank well.
Then the browser uses JS to fetch the content using JS

But initially with no content gives bad SEO

So, now with Next JS we get Server side rendering. The content gets loaded on the server(let's s ay vercel for example)
and then the server sends the content to the browser.
So, the first thing the browser/client sees isthe fully loaded content, not empty
So, google's bots can go through their content and index them and rank them well.
